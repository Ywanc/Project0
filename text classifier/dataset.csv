2015_SGHC_125,facts,"Prior to joining the Defendant, the Plaintiff worked as an insurance agent at other insurance companies including Phillip Securities and Manulife Financial. It is not in dispute that the Plaintiff’s services at Manulife Financial were terminated for reasons relating to persistency and compliance issues. The Plaintiff was first engaged by the Defendant as a financial adviser and financial services manager on 26 July 2005. At that time, the Defendant engaged the Plaintiff subject to a period of close supervision due to reference check reports the Defendant had received, and on which MAS had made enquiries of the Defendant. That said, it is apparent that the Plaintiff performed well enough to be promoted to the position of a financial services director in 2007, when he led a group of advisers under his own agency organisation, “Ramesh Organisation”. These advisers were formally employed by the Defendant. In 2009, the Plaintiff was promoted to a senior financial services director (“Senior FSD”).  At all material times, the Plaintiff was authorised to act as an agent for the Defendant for the purposes of soliciting and advising on life insurance applications, annuities and other products offered by the Defendant. The Plaintiff was not an employee of the Defendant. It is apparent that the Plaintiff received commissions based on the insurance policies sold by Ramesh Organisation. The Plaintiff’s scope of work as a Senior FSD was to recruit, train and supervise advisers for the Defendant. In doing so, the Plaintiff would assess the sales figures and persistency ratios of the advisers directly under him. Persistency ratios are essentially a measure used to track the number of insurance policies sold by advisers that are still in force over a certain period of time. The Plaintiff gave evidence that from January 2007 to April 2011, the Defendant had always relied on a 19-month persistency ratio to assess the performance of the advisers under his supervision. The 19-month persistency ratio was a measure of how many regular and single premium policies are still in force over an 18-month period. As at April 2011, the Plaintiff had 47 advisers under him in Ramesh Organisation."
2015_SGHC_125,decision,"I will now deal with each of the Plaintiff’s claims in turn below. Defamation To succeed in an action for defamation, the Plaintiff must prove that (a) the Defendant published the words, (b) the words identify the Plaintiff as the person defamed, and (c) the words are defamatory (see Lee Hsien Loong v Review Publishing Co Ltd and another and another suit [2009] 1 SLR(R) 177 at [23] (“ Review Publishing ”)). In the present case, both elements (a) and (b) are not disputed. The only contention relates to the issue of whether the words complained of are defamatory of the Plaintiff. In particular, the parties disagree on the meaning that should be ascribed to the First and Second Statements on Persistency and Compliance. I shall thus first consider whether the statements are defamatory. Thereafter, I will consider the defences the Defendant raises, namely, consent, estoppel or waiver, justification and qualified privilege."
2015_SGHC_125,rationale,"In relation to the defence of justification, the essence of the Defendant’s claim is that the First and Second Statements on Persistency are true and not misleading. Similarly, the Defendant takes the position that the First and Second Statements on Compliance, when read with its subsequent communications on compliance issues, are true and not misleading. As a whole, the Defendant submits that its correspondence presented the truth. The defence of justification requires a defendant to prove the truth of the “substance or gist” of the defamatory material; it is not necessary to prove the truth of every word in the defamatory publication (see Aaron at [73]; Tan Chor Chuan and others v Tan Yeow Hiang Kenneth and others [2006] 1 SLR(R) 16 at [72]; Chase v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2003] EMLR 11 at [34]). As provided for in s 8 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Defamation Act”), the defendant is not required to prove every charge so long as the other unproved charges do not materially injure the plaintiff’s reputation any further (see also Arul Chandran at [134]). Section 8 of the Defamation Act would, however, not assist the defendant if the words complained of only give rise to one charge against the claimant or if the defendant can only prove a charge that is different or less serious than the one he is required to. In the circumstances, the court must therefore first identify the appropriate level of defamatory meaning or imputation before determining whether the defence of justification has been made out on the facts of the case. As I have found that a prima facie case of defamation has not been made out in respect of the First and Second Statements on Persistency (because the statements are not defamatory), I will go no further to discuss the defence of justification on the same. I should, however, mention that even if the First and Second Statements on Persistency bore a defamatory meaning, on the facts and evidence placed before me, the 13-month and 19-month persistency ratios set out in the First and Second Statements on Persistency appear to be correct. On the evidence, the Plaintiff’s persistency ratios (whether 13-month or 19-month) appear to have been correctly calculated. Although the Plaintiff has complained that the performance of Ramesh Organisation using a 19-month persistency ratio was much better (and that the 13 month ratio should not have been used at all), the evidence is clear that there is no standard norm used in the industry. Indeed, as mentioned above, it appears that some insurance companies use one formula for calculating persistency and assessing remuneration, and another method for assessing the quality of an insurance policy. According to Mr Williams, the Defendant had decided to use a 13-month persistency ratio as this was a better measure of quality. What is clear is that persistency ratio is an important measure of the quality of the policies that have been entered into. Insurance commissions earned by agents are normally front-loaded in that they are paid in the first year of the policy. In most cases, it would not be in the interests of the policyholder to surrender his policy or to let it lapse at the end of the first year. This is a point that I will return to in connection with the defence of qualified privilege."
2015_SGHC_125,decision,"In summary, I conclude that: (a)     The Plaintiff’s claim in defamation in respect of the First and Second Statements on Persistency fails. I find that the statements do not even bear a defamatory meaning. And, even if that were not the case, the Defendant has succeeded in raising the defences of justification and qualified privilege. Moreover, in relation to the Second Statements on Persistency, the defence of consent succeeds. (b)     The Plaintiff’s claim in defamation in respect of the First and Second Statements on Compliance fails because the defences of consent, justification and qualified privilege apply to negate the Defendant’s prima facie liability. (c)     The Plaintiff has failed to prove malice to counter the defence of qualified privilege."
