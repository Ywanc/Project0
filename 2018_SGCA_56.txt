On 7 December 2015, the appellant (“NTUC Foodfare”) commenced the suit from which this appeal arises. On 12 May 2017, 11 days before the trial began, the respondents served an OTS (“the OTS”) on NTUC Foodfare, which states: The Defendants offer to settle this proceeding on the following terms: 1. The Defendants shall pay to the Plaintiff the sum of S$225,000.00 (the “Settlement Sum”). 2. The Plaintiff shall file a Notice of Discontinuance with no order as to costs within 7 days of the receipt of the Settlement Sum by the Plaintiff. 3. This settlement is in full and final settlement of all or any claims whatsoever arising out of or in connection with this action … [emphasis added] By the OTS, the respondents offered to pay NTUC Foodfare S$225,000 (the “Settlement Sum”) in settlement of its claims. Importantly, the OTS did not provide for NTUC Foodfare to receive a separate sum for the costs it incurred prior to 12 May 2017. NTUC Foodfare was to receive the Settlement Sum only. Significantly, the OTS also did not specify a date on which it would expire. NTUC Foodfare submits, and the respondents do not deny, that all of the affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”) for the trial were filed by 12 May 2017. We are also satisfied that much of the preparatory work for the trial, which was set down for seven days, would have been completed by this stage. Following the trial, the claim was dismissed in its entirety. NTUC Foodfare did not accept the OTS at any time. However, on 16 April 2018, after the trial, but before the hearing of this appeal, NTUC Foodfare wrote a letter to the respondents stating that it was prepared to accept a total sum of S$176,176.85 (all in) in settlement of the dispute (the “ Calderbank Offer”). The respondents did not accept the Calderbank Offer. On 19 July 2018, we delivered the Judgment, holding at [84] that the respondents were liable to NTUC Foodfare in the sum of S$176,176.85 and interest at 5.33% per annum on the said sum from the date of the writ to the date of the Judgment (“the Judgment Sum”).
